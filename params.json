It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","body":"hide-stash\r\n==========\r\n\r\nEveryone has some stuff \\*cough\\* porn \\*cough\\* they don't want others to see or access. Unfortunately I don't have a Personal Computer, and I had some stuff I wanted to hide. I tried using some softwares but they just didn't seem right. So I made a small script that uses the oldest trick in the book - **Renaming Files**\r\n\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\nI am not a very experienced programmer and have very little experience. So you might think this script is `Shitty`.\r\n![This is how I feel](http://i.imgur.com/6Uh8G.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Limitations\r\n* The .py files have to be at the to of the diretory you want to hide.\r\n* Directory names remain unhanged.\r\n* Some filenames are reserved. (`hidden`, `temp` etc.)\r\n* No Unit tests. (Read disclaimer)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* Rename files with a different extension.\r\n* Rollback to original filenames\r\n* Flexible configuration\r\n* Can create backups in case things go wrong. (Not automatially)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n#### Hide files\r\nPlace the `.py` files in the diretory you want to hide. So if you put the files in `/foo/bar/`, it will hide all files inside of `bar`.\r\n\r\nRun `python rename.py`\r\n\r\nA file called `temp` will be created.\r\n\r\n#### Unhide files\r\nRun `python rename.py`\r\n\r\n#### Backup filenames and structure\r\nRun `python backup.py`\r\n\r\nA file named `backup_pickle` will be created. Read the internals of `backup.py` for more info.","name":"Hide-stash"}
